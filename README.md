Yutani Window Manager

Initially meant to be a Wayland compositor, hence the name "Yutani" (Weyland-Yutani from the Alien film series). Direction since shifted to traditional Xlib, name stuck because Alien is good and I suck at naming things.

This is under heavy development and will likely be broken at any given time.  I haven't touched Xlib in over a decade and this, more than anything, is just a learning exercise for myself.
